# 🧬 The Medical Data Science Mastery Path

**Goal:** Transition from Physician (MD) to Medical Data Scientist (Medical AI).

**Core Philosophy:** "Deep Foundations." Build the mathematical architecture (Mechanism) first to enable novel medical innovation later.

## 👨‍⚕️ About This Roadmap
This repository tracks my rigorous transition from clinical medicine (Emergency Physician, MD) to computational medicine. Unlike standard data science paths, this roadmap emphasizes the **mathematical first-principles** required to understand deep learning architectures at a mechanistic level, specifically for application in healthcare.
